\usage{
sim_next_gen(genealogy, r0, mutator, gen_num = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{genealogy}{A genealogy data structure holding all the previous generations. TODO: link to general documentation. GH issue #6.}

\item{r0}{The number of offspring each molecule produces. Currently restricted to being an integer, but this will become a more complex construct in future versions (GH issue #17).}

\item{mutator}{A list with two elements fun and args specifying the function that mutates parents into their offspring and the list of arguments said function requires.}

\item{gen_num}{The generation number. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A genealogy data structure. TODO: link to general documentation on a genealogy. GH issue #6
